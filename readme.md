Resource Replaces Plugin
=======================================================================

This is a simple plugin, it replaces the domain name of your enqueued
javascript and css files to point to a different one. 

Why?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Because CDN's generally have a different hostname than your site

How?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just drop it into your plugins directory, activate it and update your
settings. 

It's not working!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Open an issue on this repository and I'll look into it. If you're not
enqueing your resources correctly though, that's your problem not mine.
